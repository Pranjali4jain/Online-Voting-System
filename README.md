A web-based platform that enables electronic voting is known as an online voting system. Physical polling places are no longer required, which lowers election costs and improves the voting experience for voters. Additionally, it improves the voting process' accuracy, security, and transparency to guarantee free and democratic elections.
To increase security and accountability, it can also have extra features like voter authentication, vote verification, and auditing tools. Overall, an online voting system can improve accessibility, effectiveness, and security of the voting process for both voters and election authorities.
